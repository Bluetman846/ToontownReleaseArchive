# Toontown Beta

## About

The files within this folder are release builds of Beta versions of Disney's Toontown Online.

Toontown Online's beta was split into three phases:

* Beta 1 *(August 2001 - January 16, 2002)*
* Beta 2 *(September 10, 2002 - October 21, 2002)*
* Limited Engagement *(October 21, 2002 - June 2, 2003)*

The last phase, Limited Engagement, was technically considered to be the full release of Toontown by the developers. Officially, however, the marketing team did not launch Toontown until June 2nd, 2003.

## Archived Releases

* **1.0.5** - September 5, 2001 - *Donated by Joe Shochet*
  * As this version predates any public version of Panda3D, the files can be easily viewed with the [ToontownBetaExplorer](../../Tools/ToontownBetaExplorer) tool.
