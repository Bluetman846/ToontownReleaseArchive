# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this archive! Despite closing in 2013, the preservation of Toontown Online has been made possible thanks to the amazing community that has kept it alive.

## How can I help?

There are two methods of contributing that are incredibly helpful:

### Releases

The main purpose of this repository is to store archives of significant release builds of Disney's Toontown Online. To find all of those significant builds, we need YOUR help!

We consider significant builds to be Toontown Online install folders that contain one of these things:

* Files that date on or around major game updates (Initial release of Goofy Speedway, Cog HQs, Accessories, etc.)
* Files that contain an international version of Toontown Online
* Files that predate the official release of Toontown Online (June 2, 2003)
* Files that have some unique quality compared to standard releases (Unpalettized assets, accidental code leaks, unreleased Toontown Test content, etc.)

Check out the steps for [Basic Contributions](#basic-contributions) below if you have any of these files that you are interested in contributing. Alternatively, if you are familiar with the Git, check out the steps for [Advanced Contributions](#advanced-contributions).
